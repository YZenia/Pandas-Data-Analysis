Certainly! Here's a comprehensive description for the repository, including an example of the complex combined analysis graph and static comparisons. We'll also reference the example images you've mentioned.

### Repository Description

---

# Two-Wheeled Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a Dash-based web application for analyzing and visualizing data on various models of two-wheeled electric vehicles. The application provides an interactive interface for comparing different models based on various parameters such as price, battery capacity, voltage, and power. Users can also save the generated graphs as HTML files for further use.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphs**: Compare different models using interactive scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts.
- **Customizable Views**: Select specific models to highlight and compare.
- **Statistical Analysis**: View detailed statistical analysis, including mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.
- **Save Graphs**: Save the generated graphs as HTML files for later use.

## Example Graphs

### Complex Combined Analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/two-wheeled-electric-vehicle-analysis.git
    cd two-wheeled-electric-vehicle-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install dash pandas plotly
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`.

## Usage

- **Select Models**: Use the checklist on the left to select specific models for comparison.
- **Save Graphs**: Click the "Сохранить графики как HTML" button to save the current view of the graph as an HTML file.
- **View Statistics**: Switch between different tabs to view statistical analyses of different parameters like price, battery capacity, power, and voltage.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main application script.
- `saved_graphs/`: Directory where saved HTML graph files will be stored.
- `Program_4_Plottig/saved_graphs/example_dataset_1plot.jpg`: Example image of a complex combined analysis graph.
- `Program_4_Plottig/saved_graphs/example_static_1plot.jpg`: Example image of a static comparison graph for price.

### Instructions

1. Save the above text into a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your repository.
2. Place the example images (`example_dataset_1plot.jpg` and `example_static_1plot.jpg`) in the specified directory (`Program_4_Plottig/saved_graphs/`).
3. Ensure all the necessary files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt` if needed) are in place.

### Example Graph Images

The repository should contain these example images in the correct directory to illustrate the application's output in the README.

With these steps completed, your repository will have a comprehensive description, including example visuals to help users understand the application's functionality and usage.
